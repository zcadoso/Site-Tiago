## Summary Of the Project
This is a shortcut to access your favourite anime series with your preferred providers, all in sync with the selected animes in your MyAnimeList profile.

Avoid surfing the internet or the providers looking for your episodes, just seat in and enjoy.

With this single page you can test several providers and update your MyAnimeList episodes easily.

It also skips some advertising from providers home sites, because you'll access to the episode page directly.
